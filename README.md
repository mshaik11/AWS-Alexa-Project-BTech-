FIRST AID ASSISTANCE THROUGH ALEXA 

First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious
illness or injury. In some cases, first aid consists of the initial support provided to someone in the middle of a medical emergency. This support might help them survive until professional help arrives. In other cases, first aid consists of the care provided to someone with a minor injury. For example, first aid is often all that's needed to treat minor burns, cuts, and insect stings. We designed this project in such a way that it gives the immediate measures or steps to be taken for a particular emergency cases.
